/// <para/>   Useful for: Lens setters and updaters - Monads can be derived from monad transformers applied to the Identity monad.
/// <para/>   The Identity monad is a monad that does not embody any computational strategy. 
///           It simply applies the bound function to its input without any modification. 
///           Computationally, there is no reason to use the Identity monad instead of the much simpler act of simply applying functions to their arguments.
///           The purpose of the Identity monad is its fundamental role in the theory of monad transformers.
///           Any monad transformer applied to the Identity monad yields a non-transformer version of that monad.
///           Its applicative instance plays a fundamental role in Lens. </summary>
