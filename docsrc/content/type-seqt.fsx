SeqT&lt;Monad&lt;bool&gt;, 'T&gt;
=====================

This is the the Monad Transformer for `seq<'T>` so it adds sequencing to existing monads by composing then with `seq<'T>`.

Any monad can be composed, but a very typical usage is when combined with `Async` or `Task`, which gives rise to what's called async sequences.

Therefore the [AsyncSeq](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Control.AsyncSeq) library can be considered a specialization of this monad in Async.

The original post from AsyncSeq can be found [here](http://tomasp.net/blog/async-sequences.aspx) and we can run those examples with `SeqT` by adapting the code.

In order to do so we need to be aware of the design differences of both implementations.

#r "nuget: FSharpPlus"

open System.Net
open FSharpPlus
open FSharpPlus.Data

let urls =

    "http://google.com"; "http://msn.com"; ]

// Asynchronous sequence that returns URLs and lengths
// of the downloaded HTML. Web pages from a given list
// are downloaded asynchronously in sequence.
let pages: SeqT<_, _> = monad.plus {

            yield url, html.Length
        with _ ->
            yield url, -1 }


// Print URL of pages that are smaller than 100k
let printPages =
    pages
    |> SeqT.filter (fun (_, len) -> len < 100000)
    |> SeqT.map fst
    |> SeqT.iter (printfn "%s")
 
printPages |> Async.Start

(**
To make it work with tasks simply add `|> Async.StartAsTask` between `wc.AsyncDownloadString (Uri url)` and `|> SeqT.lift` then run eveything but the `printPages |> Async.Start`.
