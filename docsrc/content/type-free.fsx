Free<'Functor<'T>, 'T>
======================

This type is an implementation of the [Free Monad](https://www.google.com/search?q=free+monad) which is generic to any [Functor](abstraction-functor.html).

The Free Monad is used typically to describe a pure program at high level and separately write different interpreters for it.

Related Types
-------------

 - [Coproduct](type-coproduct.html): A [Functor](abstraction-functor.html) used in conjunction with the Free Monad to combine different instruction sets.




Examples
--------

Free monad-interpreter in F# from [Mark Seemann's blog](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/07/17/a-pure-command-line-wizard) but encoded with Free.

 - Highly recommended Matt Thornton's blog [Grokking Free Monads](https://dev.to/choc13/grokking-free-monads-9jd) and [Interpreting Free Monads](https://dev.to/choc13/interpreting-free-monads-3l3e).
   It contains examples using F#+ and an explanation from scratch.

 - Mark Seemann's blog has an [article series](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/06/27/pure-times/) which ends 
   up describing Free Monads although he doesn't use F#+ and therefore either repeats boilerplate code or switches to Haskell.
   Anyways some code from those series (like the above fragment) can be found in [our test suite for Free](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpPlus/blob/master/tests/FSharpPlus.Tests/Free.fs) simplified using Free and Coproduct types.

 - Scott Wlaschin's [13 ways of looking at a turtle](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/13-ways-of-looking-at-a-turtle) is also a series which ends up defining a Free Monad, without using F#+ but with boilerplate code instead.
