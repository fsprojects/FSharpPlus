# DEVELOPER GUIDE

### General Goals / Philosophy:

 - Consistency: the design of this library should maximize consistency, this is relation between group of functions, argument types, types and abstractions they represent. By doing this, it's easier for the user to guess what are the expectations instead of relaying all the time to check docs and/or source code. Therefore naming should be carefully considered in order achieve this goal. 
 - Non intrusive: all additions to this library should not change existing functionality of F# language and FSharp.Core and in cases we they do change, we force the use to open a specific module/namespace 
 - Non opinionated: as much as possible we're not trying to force the user to solve problems in a specific way, instead we try to give generic ways to approach a problem from different angles. We think that specific ways of using this library should be eventually defined by a company that wants to use it to solve problems in a specific way and in order to achieve that goal, a small set of functions, type aliases can be added on top of F#+ for that purpose, but we try to keep the library as neutral as possible.
 - Trust users: we don't apply the principle of "removing functions that could be used in a wrong way", we assume the user has enough skills to decide what's a good use and what is a bad use of a specific function, we're not trying to educate users by hiding stuff, that's not the goal of this library, though there's a lot to learn, but for that there are general guidelines and normally there should be also specific ones for each company. This doesn't mean that we'll provide poor docs.
 - Coding style: we don't have a specific set of rules, but we try to stick to general coding conventions with some relaxation in order be able to align code in places where this is convenient. For instance when there's a big set of overloads, this makes it easier to read but also easier to edit the code with multiline editor support. The best advice is to try to copy existing style. For signatures, we try to follow FSharp.Core design, ie `'T` not `'a`.
 - Naming commits: Use a very short and descriptive sentence in imperative mood, as if completing the sentence "If applied, this commit will ...". For more details [use this](https://cbea.ms/git-commit) as a reference.
 - PR's: try to keep them as atomic as possible, if a PR is found that touches many unrelated areas it will be asked to split in different PRs. A typical example is a PR that adds a specific functionality but also fix bugs, or typos in the docs. If we eventually revert that functionality, the other changes will be reverted as well which might not be desired. Draft PRs are encouraged and feel free to ask for advice in the middle of the code writing process. Use the same naming convention as for commits.
 
 - This is F#: although F#+ contains some abstractions inspired in libraries used in other languages, those concepts are translated to F# standards and eventually adapted to fit better in F#.

### Extensions

This library defines many extensions for different types.
Some of these functions are conceptually connected, in that they represent an abstraction and sometimes they have indeed a generic version of the function which doesn't require typing the type as module prefix.
Note that in these cases, normally the names are the same but this is not a rule, there are cases where the name differs to avoid collisions or confusion with other functions, for example:

 - `map` is a generic function, and we have many types implementing it, but for dictionaries this correspond to `mapValues`
 - `min` is a non-generic function operating in collections, but its generic counterpart is `minimum` to avoid collision with the built-in `min` function (minimum between two values).
 
So, what this means is, we're not providing generic functions based on names, although in many cases names are the same, we need to take into account:
 
 - F# core has some inconsistencies as it's not a type classes based library. A typeclasses based library is not necessarily something that implements a trick for typeclasses, but something that is designed as if we had support for them, I mean capturing some generic concepts and making them clear in the names chosen for every functions.

 - But here we're not attempting to fix F# core, we want to build on top in a non intrusive way, and try to re-use all the consistent concepts, idioms and de-facto naming conventions from F# core as much as possible without increasing the inconsistency level already there. Keep in mind, in F#+ **we try to expand FSharp.Core functionalities, but we are trying not to be intrusive**, as stated before: F#+ builds upon FSharp, using generic programming techniques to help avoid boiler plate code. However, by naming conventions and signatures it can be seen to 'enhance' rather than 'replace' existing patterns as much as possible.

So the solution sometimes require some creativity like thinking new names that make it clear what the function does without departing too far from existing naming conventions. 
 
Another interesting case is the `zip` related functions:

 - For collections like types, in F# core it's normal to find `zip` / `map2` functions, which acts pairwise. But another possible implementation is the applicative zip which works cross product.
 - Here we define 2 generic functions, `lift2` which corresponds always to the applicative instance, so normally in non-collections it will correspond to the non-generic `map2` but since collections already have (or at least it's expected to) a `map2` acting pairwise, in those cases only we provide a `lift2` extension and that's what's used for its generic counterpart.
 
 - The other generic function we provide is `zip` which is available mainly for collection like types and although they match the non-generic name, note that the behavior is not exactly the same, because F# core throws errors for list and arrays when the number of elements are different. So we could say that in fact it matches `.zipShortest` when defined, otherwise it matches `.zip`.

So these zip related functions are a good example of how we do our best to fix FSharp.Core inconsistencies in a non-intrusive way.


### Abstractions

The abstractions represented in the Control namespace of this library are a set of types that in fact represents generic functions, we call these types and we'll refer to as "Invokables".

These Invokables are organized in such a way that resemble static interfaces, typeclasses, concepts or traits in other languages where they have a type system construct enabling higher kinds and ad-hoc polymorphism.

In F#+, due to the constraint of targeting CIL which doesn't have first class support for Higher Kinds, we can't enforce that a specific type parameter belongs to a specific abstraction. So generic type parameters are normally given the name of the abstraction, in the various type signatures that forms the idioms of this library implementation. As an example, the signature for generic `map` is written as `('T -'U) -> '``Functor<'T>``-> '``Functor<'U>`` ` which will be rendered as `('T -'U) -> 'Functor<'T> -> 'Functor<'U>`  where `Functor` is the name of the abstraction and all types which align with a Functor can go there.

Due to that, they don't carry any effect on implementation as they are just arbitrary labels for the generic type parameters, useful to communicate the intention to the developers and users of the library. Still F# type system will normally show some constraints at the method level, but these constraints are sometimes not very helpful in communicating the related abstraction.

The concrete implementation of these abstractions on the other hand is done, minimally, by defining a concrete type (an Invokable) per function.

For example, one of the simplest abstractions `Monoid` has its core implementation split under two types `Plus` and `Zero`.

Those Invokers contains static methods of several kinds:

* concrete overloads, for example Monoid's `Plus` will have overloads of a `Plus` method (named the same as the type defining those) for each of the BCL and FSharp.Core types that ought to support the `Monoid` type class, e.g. one to concatenate two strings, one to concatenate two lists, one to concatenate two arrays, and so on and so forth.
* an _invokable_ method, that should always be defined as `inline`, which embeds the SRTP dispatcher machinery that is used to pick the right overload (whether defined in F#+ or outside of it)
* a default or set of default implementations, those may need to be defined in an intrinsic type extension due to F# compiler implementation details to enable being picked up correctly for types that end up supporting the abstraction when such abstraction comes with a default implementation expressed in terms of composing several functions, those are always defined as `inline`.



#### Concrete implementations

We should add as much concrete implementations for primitive types (types coming from F#+ dependencies which are mainly BCL types and FSharp.Core types) as possible, since the end user won't be able to add them later.

#### Defaults

The goal of default implementations is to allow users of the library to write less code, as an example we expect the user will add `Bind` , `Return`  to their specific monad types, but we don't want to force him to add `Join` although if he adds it, code might be more efficient.
But those defaults are not intended to be used by developers of F#+ as we should afford writing more code in order to maximize usability of the library. You can read this as "the principle is to allow user to write less boilerplate, and because of that we have to put some boilerplate inside F#+".

#### Invoker

The signature of the Invoker should ideally be the same as the generic function. This will allow Invokers to be used in lieu of functions in scenarios where passing a type leads to more generic code than passing a function.
