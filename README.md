==========

F#+ is a base library that aims to take F# to the next level of functional
programming. 

*What if we imagine F# as more than it is?*

F#+ builds upon FSharp, with a special focus on generic programming.
However, by naming conventions and signatures it can be seen to
'enhance' rather than 'replace' existing patterns as much as possible.

Getting started is easy since you can start with enjoying some of the extensions
and generic functions, but you will find other parts of F#+ unfold before you
and become useful the deeper in you get.

See the [documentation](//fsprojects.github.io/FSharpPlus) for more details.
